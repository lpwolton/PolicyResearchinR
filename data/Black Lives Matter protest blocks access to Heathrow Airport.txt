LONDON - British police arrested several protesters after a British offshoot of the Black Lives Matter movement blocked a road leading to London's Heathrow Airport.
It was one of many demonstrations held Friday by Black Lives Matter U.K., which was holding its first major protests.
Video footage showed protesters blocking access to Heathrow, one of the world's busiest airports, by lying down on a road leading there. The activists could be heard chanting "black lives matter" as traffic began to block up behind them.
London's Metropolitan Police Service said 10 people were arrested at the demonstration near Heathrow, six of whom were "locked on" to one another. Heathrow officials apologized for any delays.
The Black Lives Matter movement started in the United States three years ago because of the killings of black people by law enforcement officers. The campaign has since spread to other countries, including Brazil, Canada and several European nations.
On Friday, the British organization was calling for a day of coordinated action across the country. Protesters said events were planned for London, Birmingham, Manchester and in Nottingham, where a group of protesters lay down on tracks of a tramline near the city center.
The group has called for an end to "racialized sexism, classism and homophobia." In a video posted on social media, the activists say law enforcement officers disproportionately target black people in Britain.
The protests come on the fifth anniversary of the death of Mark Duggan, who was fatally shot by police in north London in August 2011. Imani Robinson, a spokeswoman for Black Lives Matter U.K., told the BBC, "This is an intentional disruption because our lives, our ability to live free and dignified lives, is being disrupted every day."
When asked whether there would be more protests of this kind, Robinson said, "Until black lives matter in the U.K., we won't stop organizing."
