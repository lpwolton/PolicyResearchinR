Reversing course two days after news reports sparked a backlash, Starbucks says it will now allow employees to wear T-shirts and accessories in support of Black Lives Matter.
"We see you. We hear you. Black Lives Matter. That is a fact and will never change," the company said in a letter posted Friday. "This movement is a catalyst for change, and right now, it's telling us a lot of things need to be addressed so we can make space to heal." 
Earlier this week, BuzzFeed reported that the coffee giant turned down a request from baristas and other employees who wanted to show their support for the BLM movement. In a memo to its 250,000-member workforce, Zing Shaw, the company's diversity officer, said, "There are agitators who misconstrue the fundamental principles of the Black Lives Matter movement - and in certain circumstances, intentionally repurpose them to amplify divisiveness." 
The decision sparked backlash and came just days after Starbucks had issued a "Black Lives Matter" statement of solidarity and committed $1 million to racial justice groups as protests broke out across the United States  following the death last month  of George Floyd, a black man, in police custody in Minneapolis.
A company spokeswoman declined to say what exactly prompted the reversal - whether it was two days of social media calls for boycotts or the current unrest in Seattle, the company's home base and where protests have led to an activist takeover of a four-block, police-free autonomous zone.
Hailey Glick, who has worked as a Starbucks barista in Raleigh, N.C., since September, said she learned of the initial denial of BLM attire through an unofficial employee Facebook group. She said she initially thought the company was simply applying its dress code policy, which prohibits personal accessories that advocate for a political, religious or personal issue - until her co-workers pointed out that the company sends employees shirts, cups and other merchandise to wear during Pride Month.
"If we can stand up for LGBTQ rights, why can't we stand up for black lives and people of color?" she said.
Glick's manager knew she attended protests in Raleigh and was supportive, she said,  but that might not be the case at stores in other cities. 
"I was very pleased with the reversal of the decision, and I think it's the right move. The only thing that I think makes me hesitate and probably makes the company hesitate too is how and where we draw the line," Glick said.
Bryant Simon, a historian at Temple University who wrote a book about Starbucks and American culture in 2009, said the company's initial position was a "particular Starbucks dance." The reversal, he said, came as a surprise.
"Lots of mass companies with a really big audience don't want to have a public political statement and alienate their audience," he said. "They can't be Ben & Jerry's. They're just too big of a company for that. Their audience is too big, their investments are too big."
What is tricky about Starbucks, Simon said, is that it markets itself as a "third place" for customers (after home and work) without embracing the political discussion that comes with public spheres. "A kind of political presence has always been part of Starbucks' proposition, the idea that they could make a difference in the world," he said. "You're buying some kind of identity, and that identity has a politics to it, but that's something that is kind of a slippery slope when you're a mass company." 
In April 2018, the high-profile arrest of two black men at a Philadelphia coffee shop  prompted the company to close more than 8,000 stores to conduct  anti-bias training.
Christina Chang, a diversity and equity consultant in Seattle, said she often uses that case in her anti-bias workshops with predominantly white groups as an example of how institutionalized racism shows up in day-to-day life.
"In the midst of everything  that's happened, they are still so flat-footed," she said. "How is that possible? The reason it's possible is that at the end of the day, you still don't have diversity at the top. You still don't have people of color with different experiences who will sit down with them and say, 'Hey, that's not cool.' "
